Vector:
using library:
#include <vector>

vector are the same with dynamic allocated array, and it have some function 

List:
Base on what we have learn about Linked list in C, now in C++ it provides a library 
#include <list> 
to define a list, and all function of it

Lambda:
structure:
[ capture clause ] (parameters) -> return-type  
{   
   definition of method   
} 

example:
[](int a, int b) -> int
{
    return a + b;
}

#define PI 3.14; 
const int g = 9.8;

[PI, g](int r) -> double
{
    return PI * r;
}


target of using Lambda: minimize memory needed to use
Lambda take a role like a local variable, after done using, deallocated it.
